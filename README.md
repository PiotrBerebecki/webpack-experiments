# Webpack experiments

## Notes:

- Run `webpack --display-error-details` to see error details

- In experiment 02 `webpack -p` reduced the size of `bundle.js` from 18kB to 6kB

- `path.join` vs `path.resolve`

  `path.join` - joins all the arguments together and normalize the resulting path
  `path.resolve` - resolves to an absolute path
